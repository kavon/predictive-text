Recipes for cake are wonderful testaments to the generations of bakers before us. Most cake recipes have been handed down from great-grandmothers to grandmothers to mothers, and passed between friends and family.

Our collection of cake recipes are the favorites, the ones that are baked for special occasions and birthday parties or when a perfect rich treat is needed to end a great meal. From rich and delicious chocolate cake to spice laden carrot cake, you'll find your favorite here.

Some have frosting recipes with them, others let you choose what type of topping you want for the cake, and others have recipes for different toppings. Each cake recipe is a completely different taste experience, and all are equally delectable. Nothing beats the smell of a cake being baked in the oven. Forget air fresheners, bake a cake for the perfect home scent!
